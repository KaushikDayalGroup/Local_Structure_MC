Refer to the file New_MC_Algorithms.pdf for the python pseudocode of this project

To Run The Project using python 

python New_MC_Method.py {bJ}

where {bJ} is the command line argument for the product of inverse temperature b and coupling constant J 

----------------------
The code is compatible with numba version '0.53.1'
